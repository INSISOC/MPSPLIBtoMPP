# MPSPLIBtoMPP - MS Project format Instances for the Multi-Project Scheduling Problem
This repository contains a collection of test instances for the Multi-Project Scheduling Problem (MPSP),  originally from the MPSPLib library (http://www.mpsplib.com), and converted into Microsoft® Project <sup>1</sup> (`.mpp`) format.  

These instances are intended to support reproducibility and benchmarking in scientific research related to multi-project scheduling and optimisation.

## Contents
- `MPSPLIBtoMPP Instances/`: Directory containing the `.mpp` files for each test instance.
- `README.md`: This file.
- `LICENSE.md`: Licensing information for the converted instances.
## One link download
Download the entire library from a single link **[here](https://github.com/INSISOC/MPSPLIBtoMPP/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)**
## Purpose
The aim of this repository is to provide the research community with a ready-to-use library of MPSP instances in `.mpp` format, facilitating:
- Reproducibility of experimental results.
- Comparative evaluation of scheduling algorithms.
- Integration with the commercial project management tool MS Project.

## Source of Original Instances
The original problem instances were obtained from the MPSPLib (http://www.mpsplib.com/), developed by **Jörg Homberger**.  
These have been converted into `.mpp` format for compatibility with Microsoft Project. Instance names respect the original source.
