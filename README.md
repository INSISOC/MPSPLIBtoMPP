# MPSPLIBtoMPP - MS Project format Instances for the Multi-Project Scheduling Problem
This repository contains a collection of test instances for the Multi-Project Scheduling Problem (MPSP),  originally from the MPSPLib library (http://www.mpsplib.com), and converted into Microsoft ProjectÂ® <sup>1</sup> (`.mpp`) format.  

These instances are intended to support reproducibility and benchmarking in scientific research related to multi-project scheduling and optimisation.

## ðŸ“‚ Contents
- `instances/`: Directory containing the `.mpp` files for each test instance.
- `README.md`: This file.
- `LICENSE.md`: Licensing information for the converted instances.
## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose
The aim of this repository is to provide the research community with a ready-to-use library of MPSP instances in `.mpp` format, facilitating:
- Reproducibility of experimental results.
- Comparative evaluation of scheduling algorithms.
- Integration with the commercial project management tool MS Project.
